# NexGoo
# Download the project from github

# Open Project folder NexGoo using Android Studio

* Step 1. Open terminal 
flutter clean
Flutter clean will delete the build folder. Manually delete the build folder, which is essentially the same as flutter clean. Restart your IDE, as it might be caching some older error logs and locking everything up.

* Step 2. Go to pubspec.yaml
When you start a new Flutter project, a simple pubspec is produced. It's at the top of the project tree and includes project information that the Dart and Flutter tooling needs to know.

* Step 3. Click Pub get 
This cmd retrieves all dependencies indicated in the pubspec.yaml file in the current working directory, as well as their transitive dependencies.

* Step 4. To build the app, please click the run button 
Click Run main.dart
